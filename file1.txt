The tallest man in the US, Igor Vovkovinskiy, has died at the age of 38 years in Minnesota.  

On Friday, the Ukrainian-born Vovkovinskiy died of heart disease while getting treatment at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota, his family said.  

His mother Svetlana Vovkovinska, who is also an ICU nurse at Mayo, announced about his death on Facebook.  

In 1989, Vovkovinskiy came to the Mayo Clinic as a child seeking treatment. At that time, a tumor was pressing against his pituitary gland, which caused it to secrete abnormal levels of growth hormone. He grew to become the tallest man in the US. His height was 7ft 8.33in (2.35m). He ended up staying in Rochester.
